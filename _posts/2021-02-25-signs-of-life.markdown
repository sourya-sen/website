A four track EP and a four part film, Signs Of Life features ambient loops, microsound and musique concrete elements over evolving drones and melodic fragments, and journeys through the frame of mind, coming to terms with the state of personal existence.

The films, shot in collaboration with [Parizad D](http://parizad-d.com) , explore the the intersecting points of engagement and indulgence.

This release marks a significant departure for me, obsoleting my Oblique moniker that I have used in the past for my artistic practises. In use since 2014, it was supposed to be an alias when performing visuals. Over the last couple of years with various projects, releases and publications, however, it has been getting harder harder for me to justify what gets published as Oblique and what remains under my own name. Therefore, after much deliberation, I have come to the decision of doing away with aliases and monikers and releasing future projects under one name, my own. 

This release is also availabe on streaming sites, find links [here](/releasesandpublications).
