N8IR is a standalone experimental audiovisual instrument and phrase generator, developed over three years of design and prototyping. The project explores the idea of a true audiovisual synthesizer â€” one where sound and image are generated and controlled together, rather than one accompanying the other.

The instrument is powered by a Teensy microcontroller and CMOS logic chips, with a modular patchbay enabling flexible interconnections. Every control has both sonic and visual consequences, producing tightly synced patterns, shifting textures, and unexpected rhythms.

Designed for immediacy and play, N8IR emphasizes hands-on experimentation over menu-diving or software abstraction. Its goal is to create a space for improvisation that is simple, tactile, and fun, while still allowing for complex emergent behaviors.

Released as open-source, N8IR is intended as a tool for community use and further development, continuing its life beyond its initial design.

N8IR has been showcased at Eyemyth Festival 2025 and Music Hackspace. It has also been used for performance at Generative Degenerate: Bombay Edition and WIP AltFest Algorave: Bengaluru Edition.
