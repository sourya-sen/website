Conceptualised in the summer of 2019, In the Cities is part celebration and part retrospective inspired by my experiences of living and travelling across various cities over a period of time, exploring temporary living and moving on. 

Written and recorded with a performance based composition practise on the modular synthesiser, it combines West Coast and East Coast synthesis techniques alongside field recordings and music concrete tendencies. 

In the Cities is a celebration of the significant years that have molded my artistic path, paying homage to the experiences and the cities that have shaped me and my creative processes.
