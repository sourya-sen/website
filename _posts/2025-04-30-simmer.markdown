This one came from a strange place. Recorded in the thick, heavy heat of summer 2024, Simmer emerged from long improvisations on a single evolving patch—droning, fractured, sometimes weightless, sometimes dense. There was no big plan, just an attempt to stay in motion when inspiration felt distant.

Listening back, making small edits, I found myself with this album. And now, I’m putting it out into the world.

“Simmer” unfolds as an intimate sonic diary, capturing fleeting moments of introspection and resolve during the sweltering summer of 2024. These excerpts, born from hours of experimentation on a minimal Eurorack setup, resonate with a sense of restless creativity and emotional rawness. The stripped-down nature of the tools mirrors the artist’s battle with creative inertia, where each patch becomes a negotiation with unease—a balancing act between atmospheric weight and the flicker of inspiration.

The pieces carry an organic, almost fragile quality, as if they could unravel at any moment. Droning undercurrents provide a grounding force, while warped melodies and fractured rhythms weave through dense, oppressive textures. This layered interplay creates a soundscape that feels both immediate and timeless. Each fragment stands as a testament to the resilience of creativity in the face of doubt, offering a cathartic release amidst the oppressive heat and haze.
