I was selected as a Fellow in OneBeat Virtual 4, a global program (July 10 – August 18, 2023) that convened 25 artists from around the world to explore assemblies — how people can meaningfully collaborate and connect through both virtual and physical modalities.

OneBeat is an initiative of the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, committed to fostering cultural exchange through creative practice.

Projects included working on multiple collaborative tracks, an interactive sound installation and a collaborative music video.

A showcase of all the output can be found [here](https://1beat.org/onebeat-virtual-gallery/assemblies/).
